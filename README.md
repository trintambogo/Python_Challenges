## Shipping Accounts Program
The program simulates logging into a business's shipping accounts software. Once logged in, the program displays the current costs of shipping x amount of items. Based on the number of items shipped, the cost to ship each item will vary.Once the cost to ship an item is set, the program will calculate the cost of shipping the entire order. Upon confirmation of the order, the program will place the order and prepare the shipment.

# FOR LOOPS
## Grade Point Average Calculator
The program collects any number of grades from a user. It then sorts these grades numerically from highest to lowest and calculates the grade point average of the user. The program then asks the average the user desires and calculates what the user must hey in order to achieve this average. Lastly, the program will make a copy of the users grades and allow them to alter one of their previous grades to see how worse or better an assignment would have changed their overall grade.

## Fibonnaci Calculator
The program calculates the first n terms of the fibonnaci sequence and displays the terms.
The program also calculates the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers to prove that these ratios approach the irrational mathematical constant of Phi; 1.618â€¦

## Factorial calculator
The program calculates factorial for any given number. 
It uses the math library to compute the value for a given factorial and its own algorithm to come up with the factorial.

## Quadratic Equation Solver
The program displays solutions to any number of quadratic equations.
The program asks the user how many quadratic equations they would like to solve, ask for the coefficients of the equation in the standard form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0,solve for x and displays the solution.The program allows for both real and complex solutions.

## Binary and Hexadecimal Converter Program
The program generates binary and hexadecimal values from 1 upto a specified user value.
The program uses list slicing to show a portion of these values. It then loops through the entire list of decimal, binary and hexadecimal values to show the relationship between numbers of diferent bases.

# LISTS
## Favorite Teachers program
The program makes a list of your favorite teachers. It shows three teachers, sorted in different ways, like alphabetical and reverse alphabetical order. It also displays the top two, next two, last favorite, and the total number of teachers on your list. You can add or remove teachers, and the program will show a summary each time.

## Basketball Roster Program
The program builds and displays a basketball roster based off user input. The program then stimulates an injury to a specific player in the roster and prompts the user to update the roster. Upon updating the roster, the program displays the final roster and wishes the newly added player good luck

## Grocery Sorter List 
The entire script simulates a grocery shopping experience using Python. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Welcomes the user to the Grade Sorter App.
   - Displays the current date and time.

2. **Grocery List Setup:**
   - Initializes a grocery list (`my_list`) with two items: 'Meat' and 'Cheese'.
   - Asks the user to input three additional items for the grocery list.

3. **Grocery Shopping Simulation:**
   - Simulates the user going through a grocery store:
     - Asks the user to input items they have just bought (three times).
     - Removes the bought items from the grocery list.
     - Informs the user that the store is out of the last item on the list and removes it.
     - Asks the user for a replacement item.
     - Adds the replacement item to the grocery list.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Prints the remaining items on the updated grocery list.

## Different types of lists program
This program compares four types of lists: strings, floats, integers, and lists of lists. It details the data type, elements, and data type of the first element in each list. Additionally, it highlights differences in sorting lists numerically and alphabetically.
