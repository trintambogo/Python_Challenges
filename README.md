## Yes Or No Polling
The program will conduct a poll on a yes or no issue. Upon starting the program a user will be prompted for an issue to vote on, the number of voters, and a password to view the poll results.The program will then conduct the poll. Each time a user votes, the program will ask for the voters full name to verify that they have not yet voted. If the voter has not yet voted, they will be presented with the issue and can vote yes or no. The vote will be recorded. Once the number of voters specified by the user has been reached, the poll
will close and a summary will be displayed. If the user enters the correct password a result ofeach voters name and how they voted will be displayed.

## Database Admin Program
The program that will simulate logging into a database and prompting a user to change their password. All usernames and passwords to the database will be stored in a dictionary. Upon entering the correct credentials, the program will prompt the user to enter a new password that is a minimum of eight characters long. If the new password meets the criteria, it will be accepted, otherwise the new password will be rejected. If the user who logged in is the admin, a list of all usernames and passwords will be displayed.

## Thesaurus Program
This is a tool that provides a collection of words and their meanings.
The program simulates a thesaurus. The program will present a user with a list of words that the thesaurus contains. Based on the users choice, the program will randomly present them with a synonym for their chosen word. Lastly, the program will displayall of the potential synonyms for each word in the thesaurus.

# CONDITIONALS
## Rock Paper Scissors Program
The program simulates playing the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors against computer AI. The program will ask the user how many rounds of the game they would like to play, simulate each round, keep score, and determine an overall winner. The program will also print the classic phrases such as “Paper covers rock” or “Scissors cut paper”.

## Guess my number program
The program that will play the classic “Hi Low” game. The program will randomly pick a number between 1 and 20. Users will then guess the number. With each guess, the program will respond that the user’s guess is either too high or too low. When the user guesses correct, or after 5 guesses, the program will end the game and summarize the results.

## Voter Registration Program
The program simulates registering to vote. If a user is 18 or older, the program will present them with a list of potential political parties to register for. Upon choosing a party, the program will confirm that the user has registered and print a specific message depending on the party joined.

## Coin Toss Program
The program simulates flipping a coin n number of times.The program presents the user an option to see the result of each individual flip. It also informs the user any time the number of heads flipped is equal to the number of tails flipped. Upon completion of all flips, the program provides a summary table that shows the number and percentage of each flip.

## Shipping Accounts Program
The program simulates logging into a business's shipping accounts software. Once logged in, the program displays the current costs of shipping x amount of items. Based on the number of items shipped, the cost to ship each item will vary.Once the cost to ship an item is set, the program will calculate the cost of shipping the entire order. Upon confirmation of the order, the program will place the order and prepare the shipment.

# FOR LOOPS
## Grade Point Average Calculator
The program collects any number of grades from a user. It then sorts these grades numerically from highest to lowest and calculates the grade point average of the user. The program then asks the average the user desires and calculates what the user must hey in order to achieve this average. Lastly, the program will make a copy of the users grades and allow them to alter one of their previous grades to see how worse or better an assignment would have changed their overall grade.

## Fibonnaci Calculator
The program calculates the first n terms of the fibonnaci sequence and displays the terms.
The program also calculates the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers to prove that these ratios approach the irrational mathematical constant of Phi; 1.618…

## Factorial calculator
The program calculates factorial for any given number. 
It uses the math library to compute the value for a given factorial and its own algorithm to come up with the factorial.

## Quadratic Equation Solver
The program displays solutions to any number of quadratic equations.
The program asks the user how many quadratic equations they would like to solve, ask for the coefficients of the equation in the standard form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0,solve for x and displays the solution.The program allows for both real and complex solutions.

## Binary and Hexadecimal Converter Program
The program generates binary and hexadecimal values from 1 upto a specified user value.
The program uses list slicing to show a portion of these values. It then loops through the entire list of decimal, binary and hexadecimal values to show the relationship between numbers of diferent bases.

# LISTS
## Favorite Teachers program
The program makes a list of your favorite teachers. It shows three teachers, sorted in different ways, like alphabetical and reverse alphabetical order. It also displays the top two, next two, last favorite, and the total number of teachers on your list. You can add or remove teachers, and the program will show a summary each time.

## Basketball Roster Program
The program builds and displays a basketball roster based off user input. The program then stimulates an injury to a specific player in the roster and prompts the user to update the roster. Upon updating the roster, the program displays the final roster and wishes the newly added player good luck

## Grocery Sorter List 
The entire script simulates a grocery shopping experience using Python. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Welcomes the user to the Grade Sorter App.
   - Displays the current date and time.

2. **Grocery List Setup:**
   - Initializes a grocery list (`my_list`) with two items: 'Meat' and 'Cheese'.
   - Asks the user to input three additional items for the grocery list.

3. **Grocery Shopping Simulation:**
   - Simulates the user going through a grocery store:
     - Asks the user to input items they have just bought (three times).
     - Removes the bought items from the grocery list.
     - Informs the user that the store is out of the last item on the list and removes it.
     - Asks the user for a replacement item.
     - Adds the replacement item to the grocery list.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Prints the remaining items on the updated grocery list.

## Different types of lists program
This program compares four types of lists: strings, floats, integers, and lists of lists. It details the data type, elements, and data type of the first element in each list. Additionally, it highlights differences in sorting lists numerically and alphabetically.
