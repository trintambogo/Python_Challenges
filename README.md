## Grocery Sorter List 
The entire script simulates a grocery shopping experience using Python. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Welcomes the user to the Grade Sorter App.
   - Displays the current date and time.

2. **Grocery List Setup:**
   - Initializes a grocery list (`my_list`) with two items: 'Meat' and 'Cheese'.
   - Asks the user to input three additional items for the grocery list.

3. **Grocery Shopping Simulation:**
   - Simulates the user going through a grocery store:
     - Asks the user to input items they have just bought (three times).
     - Removes the bought items from the grocery list.
     - Informs the user that the store is out of the last item on the list and removes it.
     - Asks the user for a replacement item.
     - Adds the replacement item to the grocery list.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Prints the remaining items on the updated grocery list.

## Different types of lists program
This program compares four types of lists: strings, floats, integers, and lists of lists. It details the data type, elements, and data type of the first element in each list. Additionally, it highlights differences in sorting lists numerically and alphabetically.
