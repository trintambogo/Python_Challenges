## Favorite Teachers program
The program makes a list of your favorite teachers. It shows three teachers, sorted in different ways, like alphabetical and reverse alphabetical order. It also displays the top two, next two, last favorite, and the total number of teachers on your list. You can add or remove teachers, and the program will show a summary each time.

## Basketball Roster Program
The program builds and displays a basketball roster based off user input. The program then stimulates an injury to a specific player in the roster and prompts the user to update the roster. Upon updating the roster, the program displays the final roster and wishes the newly added player good luck

## Grocery Sorter List 
The entire script simulates a grocery shopping experience using Python. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Welcomes the user to the Grade Sorter App.
   - Displays the current date and time.

2. **Grocery List Setup:**
   - Initializes a grocery list (`my_list`) with two items: 'Meat' and 'Cheese'.
   - Asks the user to input three additional items for the grocery list.

3. **Grocery Shopping Simulation:**
   - Simulates the user going through a grocery store:
     - Asks the user to input items they have just bought (three times).
     - Removes the bought items from the grocery list.
     - Informs the user that the store is out of the last item on the list and removes it.
     - Asks the user for a replacement item.
     - Adds the replacement item to the grocery list.

4. **Final Output:**
   - Prints the remaining items on the updated grocery list.

## Different types of lists program
This program compares four types of lists: strings, floats, integers, and lists of lists. It details the data type, elements, and data type of the first element in each list. Additionally, it highlights differences in sorting lists numerically and alphabetically.
